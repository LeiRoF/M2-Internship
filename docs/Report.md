## Abstract

Understanding the dynamics of a pre stellar cloud is a hard task due to the fact that one only have far and static observation of it. But what if one think the problem in a different way? One can create a numerical simulation of a pre stellar cloud, and the, generate observations of it. From this mock observations, one can train a neural network to extract information and reconstruct the cloud. The goal of this internship was to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of this approach.
