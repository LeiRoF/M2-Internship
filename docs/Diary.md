- Reading BarnabÃ© Deforet's internship report
  - Tool to generate dendograms: AstroDendro
- Meeting with Julien Montillaud
  - Defined global strategy
  - **Step 1**: Search existing tools to implement 3D convolutive neural network
    - [CIANNA](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA) by David Cornu
    - Tensorflow.Keras.layers.Conv3D
  - **Step 2**: Generate simplistic models
  - **Step 3**: Implement 3D convolutive neural network
  - **Step 4**: Once it works, try to increase the complexity of the dataset to be more realistic (complexe shape, noise etc.)
  - **Step 5**: Implement [dropout](https://inside-machinelearning.com/le-dropout-cest-quoi-deep-learning-explication-rapide/) to have statistical results
  - **Step 6**: Use the model on real data

- Created project flowchart to have a global vision of the project:

- Having trouble with AMUSE installation... I spend the entire day on it, but I finally succeeded to install it.
  - There waas some additional dependencies to isntall and problem with deprecation of some functions used to build some modules, and after that there was stille a problem that required to totally clear the cache of pip and reinstall all modules, so I don't really know which manipulation were usefull and which were not.

- Getting familiar with BarnabÃ©'s code
- I need an access to the computation cluster in order to run BarnabÃ©'s code... waiting for it.
