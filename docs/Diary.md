- Reading Barnab√© Deforet's internship report
  - Tool to generate dendograms: AstroDendro
- Meeting with Julien Montillaud
  - Defined global strategy
  - **Step 1**: Search existing tools to implement 3D convolutive neural network
    - Found [CIANNA](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA) by David Cornu
    - Found Tensorflow.Keras.layers.Conv3D
  - **Step 2**: Generate simplistic models
  - **Step 3**: Implement 3D convolutive neural network
  - **Step 4**: Once it works, try to increase the complexity of the dataset to be more realistic (complexe shape, noise etc.)
  - **Step 5**: Implement [dropout](https://inside-machinelearning.com/le-dropout-cest-quoi-deep-learning-explication-rapide/) to have statistical results
  - **Step 6**: Use the model on real data

- Having trouble with AMUSE installation... I spend the entire day on it, but I finally succeeded to install it.
  <details>
  <summary>Installation problems</summary> 

  There was some additional dependencies to install and problem with deprecation of some functions used to build some modules, and after that there was still a problem that required to totally clear the cache of pip and reinstall all modules, so I don't really know which manipulation were usefull and which were not.

## 03/02/2023

- Getting familiar with Barnab√©'s code
- I need an access to the computation cluster in order to run Barnab√©'s code... waiting for it.
- Continuing reading Barnab√© Deforet's internship report and articles about LOC and SOC

## 07/02/2023

- Reading Keras documentation and try to have a first rough neural network that work with any shapes of data (3D but with any size on each axis) for input and output
  - **Vocabulary: Batch size**: Number of samples per gradient update. If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32. Do not specify the batch_size if your data is in the form of datasets, generators, or keras.utils.Sequence instances (since they generate batches).
  - **Vocabulary: Channel**: A channel is a feature map. It is the last dimension in the data. For instance, in a grayscale image, the channel is 1, and in an RGB image, it is 3. In general, the channels axis is -1 for TensorFlow and Theano, and 1 for CNTK.
    - **What's the diff√©rence between 2D convolution on N channels and a 3D convolution on 1 channel?** The 2D convolution will treat all the channels independently, while the 3D convolution will treat all the channels together, so it will be more accurate to find schemes in the channel axis. Here, we want to extract relevant information from the difference between frequencies, so a 3D convolution looks a priori more relevant.
  - **Layer: MaxPooling3D**: Downsamples the input along its dimensions (depth, height, width) by taking the maximum value over the window defined by pool_size for each dimension along the features axis. The window is shifted by strides in each dimension. The resulting output when using "valid" padding option has a shape of:
    - output_shape = (input_shape - pool_size + 1) / strides
  - Got an idea of what to do while waiting to be able to generate huge physical simulations: make simplistic prestellar cores by using a gaussian repartition of the density and apply a plummer model on it to have a prestellar core base, then make it evolve a bit with some initial speed parameters before generating mock observations of it by simulating an artificial red shift. I will start this tomorrow.
  - Made the flowchart for this part:

- I did the simplistic prestellar core generation by using a slight different process than the original idea, here is the new flowchart:

- There is still some verifications and probably improvements to ensure this model is not totally absurd before generating a huge dataset.
- Also, there is a problem concerning the view axis. I avoid heavy computation to make a true observation from a distant point of view by summing the 3D datacube along a dimension. But according to the dimension on which I sum, I need to rotate the input cubes accordingly to the point of view before saving them. As it is easier to say but tricky to do, I decided to use only one point of view. Thus, the orientation of the cubes has no importance because the AI will try to match a cube without considering the physical orientation of the system represented inside. With only one point of view, I'm sure that the relative orientation between the obervation and the output will be the same, and then avoid convergence issues.

- Added normalization at several steps of the process to have better control of the output.
- Removed the central symtery by generating the initial lorentzian distribution in a bigger space and cropping this space after the fourier transform.
- Got access to the computation cluster and started to got familiar with it.
- Generated a 1000 items dataset
- Facing a problem of memory when I try to train the neural network do to the huge size of the NN hyperparameters (more than 68 Billions for inner dense layers). The problem seems that I need one neuron for each pixel or voxel, which becomes huges even for image or spaces of 64 pixels/vocal wide. Thus, I need to find another solution in literature that doesn't involve dense layers, or at least that solve the problem in some way.

## 10/02/2023

- Found a solution to train a classic neural network model, taking adventage of the local property of the problem. In fact, an output column depend only on the corresponding input column (and maybe some neighbors columns) and not on the entire datacube. So I can train a neural network that will be focused on a small windows of columns and will scan the datacube to get all output columns and rebuild the output datacube. Here is the flowchart of the idea:

- Searched and found a solution to use Jupyter in VSC with a kernel hosted a computation node.
- Edited the function to generate the input/output vectors composed of columns insteade of entire images, but I'm facing a memory leak issue...
- Just thought to another problem: until now, I avoided the problem of orientation faced in the last part of the cloud generation process (see 08/02/2023). But as I'm now considering column (on the Z axis) at a specific X and Y coordinate, I need to ensure that all the axis are the same. Otherwise, I ask the AI to find the velocity and density profile along a line on X or Y (perpendicular to the line of sight) according to a spectrum for one given line of sight.
